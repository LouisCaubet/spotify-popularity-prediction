## Datasets

We use the SpotifyAudioFeatures dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/tomigelo/spotify-audio-features/version/3
For some parts of the code, you will also need the SpotifyData 1921-2020 dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ektanegi/spotifydata-19212020

Please download these datasets as CSV files and set PATH_TO_DATASETS to their location (first cell of the notebook).
